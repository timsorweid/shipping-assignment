## Platform Science Android Coding Challenge

### Assumptions

-    For the sake of counting vowels and consonants in names, the letter y is treated as a vowel
-    For the length of driver names, the space between names is removed
-    For the length of street names, only the street name is used. The numeric address and unit type and number are ignored
-    For the length of street names, any spaces inside the street names are removed

### Areas for feedback

-    Does it make sense for the secret algorithm to be in its own class?
-    Should I separate out global values into their own file, e.g. units array?
-    Is there a better way stylistically to break up the work? Does it matter computationally for this project?
